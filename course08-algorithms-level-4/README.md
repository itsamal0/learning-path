# Course 08 â€“ Algorithms Level 4

## About the Course

This course focuses on solving programming problems using C++.

## Problems

Number of solved problems: **65**

Problems are located in the [`problems/`](./problems) folder.
Each file is named `problemXX.cpp` and contains a standalone
solution with a header comment describing the task.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsamal0/learning-path.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the problems folder of the course:
   ```bash
   cd course08-algorithms-level-4/problems
   ```
3. Compile any problem using g++ (replace `problem01.cpp` with the file you want):

   ```bash
   g++ problem01.cpp ../../helpers/*.cpp -I ../../helpers -o problem01
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./problem01
   ```
